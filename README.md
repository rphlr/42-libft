# 42-libft
Very first project in 42 school. Libft consists in coding your own C standard library functions.

This exercise allows to consolidate the knowledge of the C pool.
Indeed, it consists in recoding a certain number of functions of the standard C library as well as other functions
that could be useful later on.

## Objectives:
- Basics of C
- Libc
- Generation of a static library

## Skills:
- Algorithms and artificial intelligence
- Rigor
- Imperative programming
